## 5. Decision Making Statements
### Aim
To Study and implement C++ decision making statements.
### Theory
In C++, decision-making statements allow a program to choose different paths of execution based on conditions. The primary decision-making statements in C++ are:
1. if Statement
2. else-if Statement
3. switch statement
#### If Statement
The 'if' statement evaluates a condition, and if the condition is true, the block of code inside the 'if' statement is executed.
#### Else-if Statement
The else-if is used to check multiple conditions. If one of the conditions is true, the corresponding block of code is executed.
#### Switch Statement
The switch statement is used to execute one block of code from multiple options. It is typically used when there are many conditions based on a single variable.
### Code
### Output
### Conclusion
we learnt about decision making statements in C++ and how to use them.
